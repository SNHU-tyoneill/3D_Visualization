## Project Overview
This project involved creating a 3D scene of a street lamp and alley way using OpenGL. The scene included a cobblestone floor and a lamp post emitting a yellow light, simulating moonlight and street lamp illumination. The project aimed to develop skills in 3D graphics and visualization, enhancing understanding of lighting, textures, and object transformations in OpenGL.

## Approach to Designing Software
When designing software, I prioritize a clear understanding of the problem and user requirements. I begin with a high-level architecture, breaking down the system into manageable modules. Each module's responsibilities are defined, and interfaces are established to ensure seamless integration. I emphasize modularity, scalability, and maintainability in my design to facilitate future enhancements and debugging.

## New Design Skills Acquired
Working on this project helped me refine several design skills:
- **Modular Design**: Enhanced ability to decompose the system into modular components, each handling specific functionalities.
- **Lighting and Texture Management**: Gained insights into effectively using lighting and textures to create realistic 3D scenes.
- **Transformations and Animations**: Improved understanding of object transformations and animations, crucial for dynamic 3D scenes.

## Design Process Followed
1. **Requirement Analysis**: Defined the scene elements and their interactions, focusing on the street lamp, cobblestone floor, brick walls, and lighting effects.
2. **High-Level Design**: Created a high-level architecture, identifying key modules such as rendering, lighting, and object management.
3. **Detailed Design**: Defined the structure and behavior of each module, including data structures and algorithms for rendering.
4. **Implementation**: Developed the modules incrementally, ensuring each component was tested and integrated smoothly.
5. **Testing and Refinement**: Conducted thorough testing, making iterative improvements based on feedback and observed issues.

## Future Application of Design Tactics
The design tactics employed in this project can be applied to future work as follows:
- **Modular Approach**: Continue to break down complex systems into manageable, reusable components.
- **Iterative Design**: Adopt iterative development, allowing for continuous testing and refinement.
- **User-Centric Design**: Focus on user requirements and experience, ensuring the final product meets user needs and expectations.

## Approach to Developing Programs
My approach to developing programs involves iterative development, starting with a basic working version and gradually adding features and improvements. I emphasize writing clean, maintainable code with ample documentation and comments to aid understanding and future modifications.

## New Development Strategies
- **Incremental Development**: Developed the scene incrementally, starting with basic geometry and progressively adding lighting and textures.
- **Prototyping**: Created prototypes to test specific features, such as lighting effects and object transformations, before integrating them into the main project.
- **Debugging and Testing**: Regularly tested the program, using debugging tools to identify and resolve issues promptly.

## Role of Iteration in Development
Iteration played a crucial role in the development process. By breaking down the project into smaller tasks, I could focus on one aspect at a time, testing and refining it before moving on to the next. This approach allowed for continuous improvement and ensured that any issues were addressed early, resulting in a more robust final product.

## Evolution of Development Approach
Throughout the milestones, my approach to developing code evolved significantly:
- **Increased Focus on Testing**: Initially, testing was minimal, but as the project progressed, I incorporated more rigorous testing practices to ensure stability.
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Realized the importance of thorough documentation, leading to better-commented code and detailed explanations of complex logic.
- **Adoption of Best Practices**: Embraced coding best practices such as consistent naming conventions, modular design, and efficient use of resources.

## Impact of Computer Science on Goals
Computer science, particularly computational graphics and visualizations, has equipped me with new skills and knowledge that are instrumental in achieving my goals. Understanding the principles of 3D graphics has broadened my perspective on software development, highlighting the importance of visual representation in problem-solving and communication.

## Future Educational Pathway
Computational graphics and visualizations have sparked an interest in further exploring related fields such as virtual reality and game development. These skills provide a strong foundation for advanced studies in computer graphics, enabling me to tackle more complex projects and research opportunities.

## Future Professional Pathway
In the professional realm, the skills acquired from this project are highly applicable to industries such as gaming, animation, and simulation. Proficiency in OpenGL and 3D graphics opens up opportunities in creating immersive experiences and visualizations, making me a valuable asset in any technology-driven organization.
